  {\begin{itemize}
    \item Rust's unique safety features make it a compelling hosted and embedded systems development.
    \item I have been working through "The Rust Book", the official step-by-step tutorial.
    \item I think Rust has a serious future in systems development, but learning about it's benefits over C/C++ has also helped me understand the shortcomings of those languages.
    \item I aim to use Rust both in stand-alone projects and to create high-speed Python bindings. 
  \end{itemize}
