    Hello, my name is Pete.
    I recently graduated with a First Class MEng in Electronics with Computer Systems from the University of Southampton.
    I started learning electronics as a hobby at the age of 15 to make my programming projects more practical and useful. 
    Studying at Southampton has enabled me to turn a beloved hobby into an exciting and fulfilling career.
    I look forward to solving challenging problems with dynamic and motivated teams.
